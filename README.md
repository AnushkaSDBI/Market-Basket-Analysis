# Market-Basket-Analysis
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. 
It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together.
For example, people who buy green tea are also likely to buy honey. So Market Basket Analysis would quantitatively establish that there is a relationship between Green Tea and Honey.
